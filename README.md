CNN to learn the mapping between two sets of images, one original, and the second transformed.

 filter_recog.ipynb: 	script implementing the inference and training of the model.
	modelbest.pth: 		saved final model state.
	generator.ipynb:	script that transforms the original images. Images must be in folder named “original_images” in the same directory as the script, in which modelbest.pth must also exist.
